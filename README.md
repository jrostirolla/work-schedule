# work-schedule

## Intro
Hey there! Welcome to my work schedule program

* To put items into your schedule, select the time you would like to modify and type in your schedule item.
* Once you've finished with your item, select the save button to set the item in place.
* To clear all items from the schedule, select the "clear schedule" button at the top

## Difficulties
* I found that the process of adding all of the selectors was quite time consuming. I did attempt to automate the selecting process, but couldn't quite get it to function as I wanted it to, so I did it the more cumbersome way
* Other than the time it took to implement all of that code, this exercise was much easier than the one presented from last week
